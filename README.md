# Customers-and-Product-analysis-using-SQL
In this guided project, I take on the role of a data analyst for a scale model car company. Using SQL, I analyze the company's sales database to answer key business questions related to product inventory, customer segmentation, and marketing strategies. Through the application of joins, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs), I extract insights that can help the company prioritize products, optimize customer targeting, and determine the budget for acquiring new customers.

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to solve real-world business problems, providing data-driven recommendations to stakeholders based on the analysis of sales, product, and customer data.
